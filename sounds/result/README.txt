Please put some sounds here which are played for a specific result. The file 
name contains the results at which it should be played using the following
format:

   <minResult>-<maxResult>.<ext>
   
Both minResult and maxResult should be integers, but are optional. If you want
to play a sound for all results greater than 20 and smaller than 30 the file 
name should look like this:
   
   20-30.mp3
   
A sound file used for all results smaller than 15 uses the following name:

   -15.mp3

For all results greater than 40 the file is named:

   40-.mp3

If you want a single file to be played for every result, just name it

   -.mp3
